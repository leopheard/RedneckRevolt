<a href="https://www.redneckrevolt.org/podcast">Redneck Revolt</a> was founded in 2016 as an anti-racist, anti-fascist community defense formation. The Redneck Revolt podcast allows the folks who make up our community to be able to directly share network news, speak out as local branches throughout the country to share a sense of whatâ€™s going on in our communities, interview folks outside the network who are also doing anti-fascist and anti-racist community defense work, and provide our analysis on a host of other subjects.<br>
